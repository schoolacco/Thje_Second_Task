# 11SE Task 2 2025 - Text-Based Adventure
### By Anthony Revel

# Sprint 1
## Requirements Definition
### Functional Requirements
* The user needs to be able to view their collection of items and must be capable of viewing the statistics of them as well
* The user must be capable of retrieving data about their 'item' collection and be capable of using these in the game to battle enemies.
* The user must be capable of saving their data (via json)
* The user must be capable of "crafting" items upon meeting requirements
### Non-Functional Requirements
* The system must be capable of executing most functions in under a second.
* The system must not fail while running and data should not be lost.
* The system should be easily navigable with minimal instructions required to understand the major functions of the system.

## Determining Specifications
### Functional Specifications
* The user must be capable of interacting with the system via a GUI interface
* The user must be capable of playing the game with no runtime errors
* The program must be capable of handling invalid inputs as well as users attempting to break the program (attempting to edit save data)
* The program must be capable of:
  * Rolling with rng
  * Increasing luck or other aspects with items
  * Saving data
  * View their collection
  * Battling using items from their collection
* The program should have an 'admin' panel as to make it reasonable to mark the program
### Non-Functional Specifications
* The program must be capable of running most functions in under a second (with an exception to those that intentionally force waiting)
* The program should be efficient minimising redundant code with loops and functions
* The UI should be easy to understand and not complex to allow for ease of use, hard to see colours should not be used and text should be reasonably sized
* Everything within the program should work as intended, menu navigation should function as intended and data should not become corrupted (unless the user attempts to edit the save data themselves, then it is their fault)
### Use Case
